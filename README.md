# Overview

Chakra Network is the first modular settlement layer designed to unlock Bitcoin's liquidity across diverse blockchain ecosystems. 

Chakra offers a high-performance and parallelized modular settlement solution for efficient liquidity flow across Execution Layers and BTC Mainnet.

Chakra Network provides a shared settlement layer that enhances Bitcoin's integration into the broader blockchain landscape, enabling other execution layers such as L2's to focus on execution without the complexities of building settlement infrastructure.

This innovative approach unlocks interconnected liquidity and economic security, fostering a dynamic and vibrant ecosystem.

Execution layers benefit from Chakra's robust liquidity network effects, ensuring secure and scalable transaction processing. 

Chakra Network empowers Bitcoin ecosystem participants to drive growth and innovation within a safe, scalable, and interoperable framework. 

In addition, it enables DeFi projects to settle native BTC to target chains without friction, which extends the composability and utilities of their tokenized assets.

# Additional context

## Main invariants

- **In  Settlement Handler Contract**
  - Only the owner can add or remove handlers from the whitelist for a given chain.
  - The contract's mode (MintBurn, LockUnlock, LockMint, or BurnUnlock) is set during initialization and determines how tokens are handled during cross-chain transactions.
  - Cross-chain ERC20 settlements can only be initiated with a valid amount (greater than 0), a valid recipient address, a valid handler address, and a valid token address.
  - The nonce for each sender is incremented with each cross-chain transaction to ensure uniqueness of transaction IDs.
  - Cross-chain transaction IDs are uniquely generated based on the source and destination chain information, sender, handler addresses, and nonce.
  - Only the settlement contract can call the `receive_cross_chain_msg` and `receive_cross_chain_callback` functions.
  - The handler receiving a cross-chain message must be on the whitelist for the source chain.
  - The contract only accepts valid payload types (in this case, only ERC20 payloads).
  - The contract's behavior (minting, burning, locking, or unlocking tokens) is consistent with its initialized mode for both outgoing and incoming cross-chain transactions.
  - Cross-chain transaction statuses are properly tracked and updated (Pending, Settled, or Failed).
  - The contract ensures sufficient token balance before performing transfers, burns, or unlocks.
  - The contract uses safe transfer methods to move tokens, checking balances before transfers.
  - Only the specified token contract (set during initialization) can be used for transfers, mints, and burns within this handler.
  - The contract maintains a consistent state between locking/burning tokens on the source chain and minting/unlocking on the destination chain, depending on the settlement mode.
  - The contract uses a codec to consistently encode and decode ERC20 transfer payloads across chains.
- **In Settlement Contract**
    1. The contract can only be initialized once due to the use of the `initializer` modifier.
    2. Cross-chain transactions are uniquely identified by their `txid`, which is derived from a combination of chain names, addresses, and nonce.
    3. The nonce for each `from_address` is incremented for every new cross-chain message sent, ensuring uniqueness of transactions.
    4. Cross-chain messages can only be sent through the `send_cross_chain_msg` function, which creates a new entry in the `create_cross_txs` mapping.
    5. Received cross-chain messages are verified using signatures before being processed.
    6. A cross-chain message can only be received once. The status of a received transaction in `receive_cross_txs` must be `CrossChainMsgStatus.Unknow` before it can be processed.
    7. The status of a received cross-chain message can only transition from `Unknow` to either `Success` or `Failed`.
    8. Cross-chain callbacks can only be processed for transactions that have a `Pending` status in the `create_cross_txs` mapping.
    9. The status of a created cross-chain transaction can only transition from `Pending` to either the received status or `Failed`.
    10. Signature verification is required for both receiving cross-chain messages and cross-chain callbacks.
    11. Only valid settlement handlers can process received cross-chain messages and callbacks.
    12. The contract maintains separate mappings for created (`create_cross_txs`) and received (`receive_cross_txs`) cross-chain transactions.
    13. Events are emitted for all major cross-chain operations: message sending, message receiving, and callback processing.
    14. The contract relies on an external signature verifier (`signature_verifier`) for validating signatures.
    15. The contract inherits from `BaseSettlement`, implying it adheres to any invariants defined in that base contract.

## Running tests

This project uses [starknet-foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/getting-started/installation.html) as the cairo development and testing framework.

The starknet-foundry version and scarb version used in this project are:

```
snforge 0.20.0
scarb 2.6.5
cairo: 2.6.4
``` 

To install them, use:

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry/master/scripts/install.sh | sh
snfoundryup -v 0.20.0
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/install.sh | sh -s -- -v 2.6.5
```

To clone the project and run tests, use:
```bash
git clone --recurse https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-08-chakra.git
cd 2024-08-chakra/solidity/handler
npm install
npx hardhat test
cd ../settlement
yarn
npx hardhat test
cd ../../cairo/handler
snforge test
```

*Note: some tests will fail in `solidity/settlement`. They're irrelevant.*

To run code coverage

```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```
