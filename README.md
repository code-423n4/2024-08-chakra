# Additional context

## Main invariants

- **In  Settlement Handler Contract**
  - Only the owner can add or remove handlers from the whitelist for a given chain.
  - The contract's mode (MintBurn, LockUnlock, LockMint, or BurnUnlock) is set during initialization and determines how tokens are handled during cross-chain transactions.
  - Cross-chain ERC20 settlements can only be initiated with a valid amount (greater than 0), a valid recipient address, a valid handler address, and a valid token address.
  - The nonce for each sender is incremented with each cross-chain transaction to ensure uniqueness of transaction IDs.
  - Cross-chain transaction IDs are uniquely generated based on the source and destination chain information, sender, handler addresses, and nonce.
  - Only the settlement contract can call the `receive_cross_chain_msg` and `receive_cross_chain_callback` functions.
  - The handler receiving a cross-chain message must be on the whitelist for the source chain.
  - The contract only accepts valid payload types (in this case, only ERC20 payloads).
  - The contract's behavior (minting, burning, locking, or unlocking tokens) is consistent with its initialized mode for both outgoing and incoming cross-chain transactions.
  - Cross-chain transaction statuses are properly tracked and updated (Pending, Settled, or Failed).
  - The contract ensures sufficient token balance before performing transfers, burns, or unlocks.
  - The contract uses safe transfer methods to move tokens, checking balances before transfers.
  - Only the specified token contract (set during initialization) can be used for transfers, mints, and burns within this handler.
  - The contract maintains a consistent state between locking/burning tokens on the source chain and minting/unlocking on the destination chain, depending on the settlement mode.
  - The contract uses a codec to consistently encode and decode ERC20 transfer payloads across chains.
- **In Settlement Contract**
    1. The contract can only be initialized once due to the use of the `initializer` modifier.
    2. Cross-chain transactions are uniquely identified by their `txid`, which is derived from a combination of chain names, addresses, and nonce.
    3. The nonce for each `from_address` is incremented for every new cross-chain message sent, ensuring uniqueness of transactions.
    4. Cross-chain messages can only be sent through the `send_cross_chain_msg` function, which creates a new entry in the `create_cross_txs` mapping.
    5. Received cross-chain messages are verified using signatures before being processed.
    6. A cross-chain message can only be received once. The status of a received transaction in `receive_cross_txs` must be `CrossChainMsgStatus.Unknow` before it can be processed.
    7. The status of a received cross-chain message can only transition from `Unknow` to either `Success` or `Failed`.
    8. Cross-chain callbacks can only be processed for transactions that have a `Pending` status in the `create_cross_txs` mapping.
    9. The status of a created cross-chain transaction can only transition from `Pending` to either the received status or `Failed`.
    10. Signature verification is required for both receiving cross-chain messages and cross-chain callbacks.
    11. Only valid settlement handlers can process received cross-chain messages and callbacks.
    12. The contract maintains separate mappings for created (`create_cross_txs`) and received (`receive_cross_txs`) cross-chain transactions.
    13. Events are emitted for all major cross-chain operations: message sending, message receiving, and callback processing.
    14. The contract relies on an external signature verifier (`signature_verifier`) for validating signatures.
    15. The contract inherits from `BaseSettlement`, implying it adheres to any invariants defined in that base contract.
